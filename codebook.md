# Code Book for Assignment

This code book describes the Input Dataset, variables and transformations performed in creating this tidy dataset


## Background
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing.[see link](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/)
Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users.

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

## Input Dataset

###HumanActivity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0

Experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers
within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six
activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING,
STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the
waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured
3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant
rate of 50Hz. 

###For each record following are provided

* Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and
the estimated body acceleration.
* Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
* A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
* Its activity label. 
* An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

### Actual Dataset includes the following

* 'README.txt'
* 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
* 'features.txt': List of all features.
* 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.
* 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.
* 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.
* 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.
* 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

### Following files are available for the train and test data. 
Their descriptions are equivalent.

* 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
* 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt files for the Y and Z axis.
* 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.
* 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
